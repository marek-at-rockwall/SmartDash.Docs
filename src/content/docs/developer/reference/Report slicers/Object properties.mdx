The following tables list the properties that are available for use when defining the JavaScript object for dynamic data definition of report slicers.

<Aside title="Property types" type="note">
  The property types of the below described properties can be:
  O = Optional
  N = Needed = May be needed under some circumstances
  C = Compulsory
</Aside>


## Page-level properties

| Property        | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | :---------- |
| `same_as` | O | Used when your page contains slicers that should have same dynamically calculated value as a slicer on another page. |
| [slicerNames] | C | All other properties of this object will be the names/titles of the slicers on this page converted to the single-word camel-case property format. |

All **visible slicers** that are required to have dynamically calculated values **must have per-page unique titles** to be able to be referenced from the dynamic value definition JavaScript object. That includes linked slicers since the order in which the user will be opening the report pages cannot be pre-determined.

Even if two or more pages contain visible slicers that are linked to other slicers these must ALL be named and must ALL have their dynamic data definitions set separately for each if they are to be dynamically populated. However, repeating the same dynamic definition for more than one slicer would be error prone and tedious. The `same_as` property is available to solve exactly that problem.

On the page level this property's value is a JavaScript array of arrays ("[[]]") where the top-level array will contain an array per each page from which you are referencing slicers. The second-level arrays are then expected to contain each two or more strings where the first string is always the name of the page that is being referenced and the second and following strings represent the names of the slicers from that page whose dynamic definitions are to be reused.

**You can only successfully use this page-level property if your slicers have exactly the same titles**, which are converted to property names as described in [Dynamic slicer definition > Page and slicer names](/developer/report-slicers/dynamic-slicer-data-definitions/#page-and-slicer-names) topic.

If your slicers have different titles you will have to use the `same_as` property on slicer level.

## Top-level slicer object properties

| Property        | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | :---------- |
| `same_as` | N | Used when this slicer should have same dynamically calculated value as a slicer on another page. This property expects a single JavaScript array containing exactly 2 string elements where the first is the property name of the page it is referencing and the second the property name of the slicer found on that page whose definition of the dynamic value should be reused. |
| `name` | O | Name of the slicer purely to help you identify the slicer. |
| `description` | O | Description of the slicer purely to help you identify the slicer. |
| `target` | N | May be needed if there are more then one target for the slicer, in which case the target must be specified. This object has two properties - `table` and `column` - which **both must EXACTLY MATCH** the same properties of the slicer.   |
| `format` | O | The format string to be used to format the items produced by the `expression`. <p>For example if the result of the `expression` is a list of dates then a format value of `"ddd d MMM"` will result in dates like "Friday 3 Jan".</p><p>A special format of **`"UTC"`** can be defined which is the same as `"yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ"`.</p> |
| `expression` | N | A function that generates a value or list of values that will be checked against `selectConditions` to be included and selected. <p> NOTE that due to the way how Power BI currently works any values that the slicer selection lists are supposed to contain but not have selected must be present in the data of the underlying target table(s). The expression can generate additional values that are not present in the underlying table(s) but these will also be automatically pre-selected. Power BI currently does not seem to allow adding values to the slicer list without selecting them at the same time.</p> |
| `selectConditions` | N | If any items generated by the `expression` are to be selected they must return `true` from running this condition expression. If the condition returns `false` and at the same time the value is not present in the underlying data table such value will not be present in the list.<p>  IMPORTANT: Only values generated by `expression` will be checked with the `selectConditions` function.</p><p>The allowed values of this property are: <ul><li>**0** (zero) = No items will be selected. (Default)</li><li>'**all**' = All the items generated by the `expression` will be selected</li><li>**N** (a positive integer) = The first N items in the list generated by `expression` will be selected.</li><li>**-N** (a negative integer) = The last N items in the list generated by `expression` will be selected.</li><li>[**an expression**] = An expression that must evaluate to `true` or `false` which will usually contain a `value` variable representing the value being tested.  <br />__________<br /> Example: `(FY() >= value < GetDate(Year(), Month(), 1)) \|\| (Year(value) > 2030)`</li></ul></p>|
| `values` | N | Is an array which can contain one of the following:<ul><li>A list of arrays where each array contains one to three members which are described below in **`value sub-arrays` properties**.</li><li>A list of objects whose properties are listed in **`value objects` properties** below.</li></ul> |
| `conditions` | N | Defines values for single-value slicers like date slicer or date range slicer, which contains two single-value fields. Each condition then corresponds to each single-value field. Must contain an array of JavaScript objects where each contains one of the following properties, but not both: `keepOriginal` or `expression`. These are described below.


## Lower-level object properties
### `target` properties
| Property        | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | :---------- |
| `table` | C | The name of the underlying data source table. |
| `column` | C | The name of the linked data table column. |


### `value` properties
The `value` property is an array of either objects or sub-arrays.

#### `value objects` properties
If the `value` array contains objects then these represent distinct list definitions and the first one whose `condition` will evaluate to `true` will be used to generate the value list and to select those values.
| Property        | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | :---------- |
| `condition` | C | An expression which when it evaluates to `true` will override any properties defined in the parent object. The `condition` in these objects in the `values` list is evaluate for each of the contained objects until the evaluation returns `true`. When it does the evaluation of any subsequent object's `condition` is skipped and the current object's properties are used as overrides for the parent objects definition. The last object in this list may have the `condition` property omitted in which case it will be used to override the parent's properties if no other preceding object's `condition` property evaluated to `true`.<p>An example condition: `FY(DateAdd('M', Now(), -2)) < FY()`</p>  |
| `name` | O | Overrides the same property in the parent object. |
| `description` | O | Overrides the same property in the parent object. |
| `target` | O | Overrides the same property in the parent object. |
| `format` | O | Overrides the same property in the parent object. |
| `expression` | O | Overrides the same property in the parent object. |
| `selectConditions` | O | Overrides the same property in the parent object. |



#### `value sub-arrays` properties
If the `value` array contains sub-arrays then each of these sub-arrays represents a single value that the slicer should contain in its selection list.

The sub-arrays can have one to three properties like so: `["string or expression", isExpression, isSelected]`.

| Property        | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | :---------- |
| `string or expression` | C | Either a direct value expressed as a string or a string representing an expression that needs to be evaluated to get the value. |
| `isExpression` | O | `true` if the `string or expression` is in fact an expression. Defaults to `false`. |
| `isSelected` | O | `true` if this value should be selected. Defaults to `false`.   |


### `conditions` property
This property contains an array which itself contains simple single-property JavaScript objects, one for each single-value field in the slicer. For example, for a simple date slicer there is only one value that may need to be dynamically set and so the array will only contain a single JS object. For a date period selector slicer which consists of two fields (Date From and Date To) - the array will contain two JS objects.

The JS objects can each contain one of the following properties, but not both as they are mutually exclusive:
| Property        | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | :---------- |
| `keepOriginal` | N | Simply leaves the value defined in the definition of the report itself in that field. |
| `expression` | N | A function that generates the single value for the corresponding slicer field. |

NOTE THAT you can use, if useful, a variable called `originalValue` within the `expression`. Its value will always be the original value coming from the report design itself.

<Aside title="Example for a date range slicer">
  A date range slicer consists of two fields and thus the "conditions" array may contain one or two JS definition objects. Only one may be necessary if only the "Date From" value needs to be redefined, but both must be specified if both or only the second ("Date To") field's value needs to be redefined, in which case the first JS definition object would look exactly like this: `{ keepOriginal: true }`.

## Definition reuse using the `same_as` property
There will be cases where you need the same slicers with the same values on different report pages. This is actually **necessary for all linked slicers** unless their dynamic values are set on the 'Cover' page and are at the same time hidden on all the other pages where they are reused (linked).

In order not to have to repeat the same definitions for multiple slicers on different pages (or even the same page) you can utilize a property called `same_as`. This property lets you set in the root of a page definition or per slicer that its dynamic data definition is the same as a slicer already defined previously in the JavaScript definition object. That way you also avoid the cases where you could otherwise change the definition of one and forget to change it for the other(s).

Here is how to do this:

### If your slicers names are identical between the pages
If you want to reuse the definitions for dynamic slicer data on another page and all the slicers that are to contain dynamic data have the exact same names on the other page, use the **`same_as` property at the root level of that page's definition** like so:

```js ins={11-15}
{
  slicers: {
    page1: {
      slicer1: {
        //..the dynamic data definition for "slicer1"
      },
      slicer2: {
        //..the dynamic data definition for "slicer2
      }
    },
    page2: {
      same_as: [
        ["page1", "slicer1", "slicer2" /*, slicer3, ...*/]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

  Here **the value of the `same_as` property** when it is found in the root of a report page definition **is an array of arrays**. Each second-level array represents a specific previously defined page. The first string in the array represents the name of the (source) page whose slicers' dynamic data setup we want to apply to the slicers with the same name on the page being currently defined (the target page). Any strings that follow after the name represent the names of the slicers from the source page whose dynamic data definition should also apply the the same-named slicers on the target page.


### If your slicer names are different between the pages
To reuse the definition of a slicer from another page where the slicer has a different name than the slicer we want to define as having the same dynamic value, put the `same_as` property into the definition of the slicer to be duplicated like so:

```js ins={11-18}
{
  slicers: {
    page1: {
      slicer1_1: {
        //..the dynamic data definition for "slicer1"
      },
      slicer1_2: {
        //..the dynamic data definition for "slicer2
      }
    },
    page3: {
      slicer3_1: {
          same_as: ["page1", "slicer1_1"]
      },
      slicer3_2: {
          same_as: ["page1", "slicer1_2"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  **The value of the `same_as` property** here, when it is found at the slicer definition level  **is a simple array** with always only two members. Same as in the note for the previous slicer type above the first string represents the name of the source report page containing the slicer whose definition is to be dynamically copied and **the second member of the array** has to match the name of the actual slicer on that source page whose dynamic data definition we are instructing the program to reuse.
