This section of the documentation is **intended for third party Power BI report developers** who wish to create additional reports to be made available privately to their organization or publicly to all organizations through SmartDash.

Third party developers will be able to charge other organizations, if they choose so, for usage of their publicly exposed reports on monthly basis.
